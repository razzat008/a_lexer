# a_lexer
    making this to not rewrite lexers for every project
    
## About
This is a lexer + parser for basic mathematical expressions.

I plan to make this generic enough to be used in multiple projects.

## How to use
 edit your Cargo.toml;
```toml
[dependencies]
 a_lexer = { git = "https://github.com/razzat008/a_lexer.git" }
```
or just
```bash
echo "a_lexer = { git = 'https://github.com/razzat008/a_lexer.git' }" >> Cargo.toml
```
